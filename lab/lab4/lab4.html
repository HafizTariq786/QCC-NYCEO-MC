<p>I'm a QCC Nursing student. I have a vast knowledge in biological and sepcially in human sciences. Computer Sciences is not my field of study but I always fascinated about coding languages. I have learnt about the basic components for creating a website and I hope to learn more so I will use this knowledge in my field of study.<p>
